## 📌 Project Overview  
Retail businesses often struggle with **inventory management** and **sales forecasting** due to fluctuating economic conditions. This project **analyzes and predicts Walmart's weekly sales** across multiple stores using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Statistical Analysis, and Machine Learning Models**.  

🚀 **Objectives of this project:**  
✔️ Identify key factors affecting sales (e.g., unemployment, CPI, temperature).  
✔️ Detect seasonal sales trends and top-performing stores.  
✔️ Predict **next 12 weeks of sales** for each store using **predictive modeling**.
